\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Problem:}
    Journalist working in dangerous countries risk indictment if their work is
    discovered. Commonly they will use live operating system residing on a USB
    drive. If this drive falls into the authorities hands, they may be declared
    guilty by possession.

\item \textbf{Existing Solution:}
   It's possible or use a drive which requires a hardware password, however this
   may look suspicious.

\item \textbf{Our Solution:}
    Overdrive aims to be as discreet as possible, there is a certain technique
    required to expose a hidden partition.

\begin{frame}{Overview}

    When working on stories abroad, journalists will commonly use the Tails
    operation system. Tails is privacy focused and does not hold persistent data
    like a traditional OS. Tails resides on a USB drive and is live booted.

    It is possible to hold encrypted persistent data, but only if it's
    encrypted. All networking is routed thought TOR (The Onion Router), which is
    an anonymous way to browse the internet.

    Overdrive is custom USB drive that will hide the partition tails is on.

\begin{frame}{Device Use}
When overdrive is inserted into a computer normally, the device will show as a
normal drive, this can be used to hold non incriminating information.

However, if the drive is inserted into a computer and the outside is held for
five seconds, the second hidden partition will show up.
