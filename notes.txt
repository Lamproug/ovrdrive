# Debugging
All files in ee/debug_v2/
All using "Star_SM3257ENAA_M1102"

no-flash.png
    - New SM3257, no flash populated

    - All with the old flash memory

# Steps
    - Started hacking one of the drives connecting different power rails.
        - Didn't do anything
    - Populated a V2 board with old flash
        - Results the exact same as with New flash
    - Populated a V1 board (blown up one) with Old SM3257
        - This started working

        - old-flash-old-SM3257-debug.png
        - Was able to provision normally
    - Populated a V2 board (16Gb) with old SM3257
        - This did not work
    - Used SM3257ENBA_N0528v1 to flash new SM3257, old Flash
        - This worked!

# Next Steps
    - Flash isn't getting destroyed
        - Q2 Rds too high?
            - Measure voltage above and below the FET
        - TVS diode in flash
        -


# Boards (V2)
    1) Hacked to try to make flash work. Probably NFG.
    2) Replaced flash to K9GAG08U0E. Removed: Q2 and C1. Not enumerating through dmesg.
    3) Populated with MT29F64G08CBABAWP
        - Works!
    4-9) Not touched
    10) Sent to Crowdsupply
