# Steps
    - Started hacking one of the drives connecting different power rails.
        - Didn't do anything
    - Populated a V2 board with old flash
        - Results the exact same as with New flash
    - Populated a V1 board (blown up one) with Old SM3257
        - This started working

        - Was able to provision normally
    - Populated a V2 board (16Gb) with old SM3257
        - This did not work
    - Used SM3257ENBA_N0528v1 to flash new SM3257, old Flash
        - This worked!

# Next Steps
    - Seems as though there are issues with the new flash and SM3257.
    - Start by replacing the SM3257. Test with this.
    - If this doesn't work, replace the flash.
    - Test destruction circuit.
